#### Right, quick post to start off the week. 

I would like to outline some short term professional and personal goals to complete over the next few months.

I'll periodically come back and update this list as tasks are completed.

- [X] Create a script to set the desktop wallpaper & lockscreen image for all users on Windows 10 Pro computers/laptops.
- [ ] Study for and achieve the 'Microsoft 365 Certified: Endpoint Administrator Associate' certification. 
- [ ] Create or locate a logging function to implement into new and existing scripts used internally at work.
- [ ] Update Windows configuration script used where I work.
- [ ] Update this blog with a custom header / banner and custom accent colours.

Thats it for now.
