Hello World, 

Today i launch my new blog using Github Pages, Hugo Go and the Hugo theme stack from [CaiJimmy](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack). I previously tested manually deploying a blog using the dot-hugo theme from [Themnefisher](https://github.com/themefisher/) which worked great at the time, but for reasons unknown to me, when i attempted to deploy for real, i experienced critical errors. 

Moving on...

The purpose of this blog is to follow along on my journey as an IT Technician, improving my knowledge on any areas of IT which serve my purpose, including but not limited to: Scripting/Automation, Microsoft 365 Administration, SecOps, OSINT, Networking, etc.  

For more information about the theme used in this blog, check the documentation: [Stack - Designed for bloggers](https://docs.stack.jimmycai.com/)
